## Description:

Using an API that'll call Johns Hopkins world-wide statistics for COVID-19, will take user entries for month and day (and validate them, throwing errors if unreadable), and then render a result with confirmed cases, deaths, and recovereds, as well as the date of the results. 

UPDATES TO COME:
1. add field to search by location
2. update date in results to US formatting
3. after Dec 31, to include a button to select either "2020" or "2021" for year.
